# Python Installation

## Check if Python is installed

Run either of the 2 commands to see if Python is installed:

```shell
python --version
python3 --version
```

You should see something like the following printed to the terminal:

```
Python 3.9.6
```

We are looking for any version of Python 3 to be installed.

```shell
python -m pip install numpy
python -m pip install jax
python -m pip install tensorflow
python -m pip install jaxlib
python -m pip install tensorboard
